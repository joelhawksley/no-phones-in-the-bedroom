title: You are your attention

We eat healthy, balanced diets. We go to the gym to get in shape. We encourage others to do the same.

Why don’t we do the same for our attention diet?

We are what we watch, listen to, and read. What we consume shapes our opinions, perspectives, and emotions.

The food we eat is the cornerstone of our physical health.

It’s time we started thinking of our attention the same way for the way what we pay attention to affects our mental health.
