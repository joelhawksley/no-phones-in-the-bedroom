title: No phones in our bedroom

For my wife Caitlin and I, our path to the healthy use of technology started in our bedroom.

When we moved in together, we decided together that we wouldn’t have phones, or any other screens, in our bedroom.

No phones in our bedroom helped us fall asleep more easily, as we weren’t looking at a bright screen right before falling asleep.

No phones in our bedroom helped us get out of bed in the morning, as we weren’t tempted to stay in bed catching up on social media.

No phones in our bedroom made us consider other ways of spending our pre-bedtime hours, such as journaling and reading books.

No phones in our bedroom revealed what we actually _needed_ our phones for in the bedroom: checking the weather to make outfit decisions.

And nothing else.
